## What is Terraform

Terraform is an open source [IaC](./infrastructure-as-code-outline.md) tool that allows you to define infrastructure for a variety of cloud providers (e.g. AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, etc) using a simple, declarative programming language and to deploy and manage that infrastructure using a few CLI commands.

Terraform is open source, cloud-agnostic provisioning tool that supported immutable infrastructure, a declarative language, and a client-only architecture.
